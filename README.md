# PolarBLE

**PolarBLE** is a C# .NET 8 WinForms application that connects to a **Polar H10 ECG sensor** over **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** and streams raw ECG data in real-time to **LabStreamingLayer (LSL)** using the [SharpLSL](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer) library.

This project is a port of the original [PolarBand2lsl](https://github.com/markspan/PolarBand2lsl) Python/Kivy implementation.
